### angiosperm_rates
Contains tree and alignment files used to generate total tree lengths for each aaRS (summarized in SubRates.csv)

### expression_levels
Contains Arabidopsis transcript per million (TPM) for each aaRS and each of three tissue types

### orthogroup_size
Contains counts of sequences in each aaRS orthogroup for the full angiosperm dataset (og_count_data.full.csv) and the dataset after excluding all taxa that only have transcriptome data (og_count_data.genome_only.csv)

### sileneae_rates
Contains alignments and trees from Sileneae aaRSs used in HyPhy tests of positive selection
